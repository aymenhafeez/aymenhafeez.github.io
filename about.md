Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Chemical engineer, recreational mathematician and (neo)vim nerd.

I'm interested in low carbon tech, particularly CCUS. My undergraduate research
revolved around developing mathematical models to gain further incite into how
microalgae growth can be optimised for CO<sub>2</sub> utilisation from carbon
capture. You can read about the background
[here](https://aymenhafeez.github.io/pi-model/)

Check out the photos page for recent trips I've been on, my
[github](http://www.github.com/aymenhafeez) for projects I'm working on and blog
for cool maths and engineering related posts
