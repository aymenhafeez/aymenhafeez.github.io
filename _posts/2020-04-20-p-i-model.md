title: Photosynthetic rate and light intensity
---

Deriving expressions to model the relation between photosynthetic rate and
light intensity in microalgae.

tyle="border:1px solid gray"> </hr>

My masters research revolved around modelling microalgae growth in order to
investigate how their growth could be optimised for CO<sub>2</sub> utilisation,
post carbon capture. As microalgae are photoautotrophic, light plays a key
role in their photosynthetic activity. A category of models which aim to account
for light intensity are known as 'P-I' (photosynthetic rate and light intensity)
relationships. These models, as the name suggests, model photosynthetic rate as
a function of light intensity. The P-I relationship consists of three distinct
regimes: light-limited, light-saturated and light-inhibited.

At low light intensities, the rate of photosynthesis is linear with light
intensity, as photosynthesis is limited by the capture of photons (Béchet, et
al., 2013). At $I_{k}$ the light intensity reaches a saturation threshold and
the microalgae become light saturated. At this point, the rate of photosynthesis
is limited by the rate of **photosynthesis reaction**. Photosynthetic rate reaches
a maximum during this phase and becomes independent of light intensity. Past a
certain inhibitory threshold essential enzymes involved in photosynthesis
become denatured and the rate of photosynthesis begins to decrease, represented
by $I_{inhib}$.

When modelling this relationship the following conditions must be satisfied:


$\newcommand{\dd}{\mathrm{d}}$
$\qquad \qquad \qquad Condition\;1$

$$
When \ \ P = 0, \ \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} = \frac{P_m}{I_k}
$$

$\qquad \qquad \qquad Condition\;2$

$$
\lim_{P \to P_m} \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} = 0
$$

$\qquad \qquad \qquad Condition\;3$

$$
When \ I = 0, \ P = 0
$$

$\qquad \qquad \qquad Condition\;4$

$$
For \ \ 0 < P < P_m, \ 0 < \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} < \frac{P_m}{I_k}
$$


where $P_{m}$ is the maximum photosynthetic rate. Early research into these
types of models in the 70's suggested a hyperbolic tangential relation between
$P$ and $I$ (Chalker, 1979). In general, we can say that the relation between
rate of photosynthesis and light intensity is of the form

$$
  \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} = f(P).
$$

Expanding $f(P)$ out into a Maclaurin series expansion gives

$$
  \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} = a_{0} + a_{1}P + a_{2}P^{2} + a_{3}P^{3} \ldots.
$$

We can derive various expressions using an increasing number of terms from the
series expansion. From _Condition 1_, $P = 0, \ \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} =
\frac{P_{m}}{I_{k}}$, we can see that $a_{0} = \frac{P_{m}}{I_{k}}$. Taking the
first two terms,

$$
  \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} = \frac{P_{m}}{I_{k}} + a_{1}P,
$$

and applying _Condition 2_ gives $a_{1} = - \frac{1}{I_{k}}$. And so we get

$$
  \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} = \left( \frac{1}{I_{k}} \right) (P_{m} - P).
$$

For convenience, let us define $\alpha = \frac{1}{I_{k}}$.
Integrating and solving for $P$ gives:

$$
  \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} = \alpha(P_{m} - P),
$$

$$
 \alpha \int \dd I = \int \frac{\dd P}{P_{m} - P},
$$

$$
  \alpha I = - \ln(P_{m} - P) + C.
$$

Using _Condition 3_ we find that $C = \ln P_{m}$. And so, after rearranging, we
get a simplified expression relating $P$ and $I$:
 
$$
  \alpha I = \ln \frac{P_{m}}{P_{m} - P},
$$

$$
  e^{\alpha I} = \frac{P_{m}}{P_{m} - P},
$$

$$
  P_{m} - P = \frac{P_{m}}{e^{\alpha I}},
$$

$$
  P = P_{m}(1 - e^{-\alpha I}).
$$

Though is a simple expression, it hasn't been found to fit experimental data
particularly well (Kurano and Miyachi, 2005). If we instead start with the first
three terms,

$$
  \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} = \frac{P_{m}}{I_{k}} + a_{1}P + a_{2}P^{2},
$$

from _Condition 2_ we get that $a_{1} = -(\alpha + a_{2}P_{m})$. Therefore,

$$
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} &= P_{m}\alpha - (\alpha + a_{2}P_{m})P + a_{2}P^{2}, \\
   &=P_{m}\alpha - \alpha P - a_{2}P_{m}P + a_{2}P^{2}, \\
   &= \alpha(P_{m} - P) - a_{2}P(P_{m} - P).
  \end{align*}
$$

Integrating and solving for $P$ gives

$$
  \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{P_{m}a_{2}}{\alpha} \right)  \right] \alpha I = \ln
  \left[ \frac{P_{m} - \left( \frac{P_{m}a_{2}}{\alpha} \right) P}{P_{m} - P}
  \right],
$$

$$
  P = P_{m}\left[ \frac{\exp\left[\alpha I\left(1 -
  \frac{P_{m}a_{2}}{\alpha}\right)\right] - 1}{\exp\left[\alpha I \left( 1 -
  \frac{P_{m}a_{2}}{\alpha} \right) \right] - \left( \frac{P_{m}a_{2}}{\alpha}
  \right) } \right].
$$

### Hyperbolic tangent expression

Setting the derivative of $\frac{\dd P}{\dd I}$ equal to zero, we can find that
the maximum slope occurs at $P = \frac{\alpha + a_{2}P_{m}}{2a_{2}} =
\frac{-a_{1}}{2a_{2}}$. And so, the maximum slope can be given by

$$
  \left( \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} \right)_{max} = \alpha P_{m} +
  \frac{a_{1}^{2}P_{m}}{4(\alpha + a_{1)}}.
$$

For the sake of convenience, let $\epsilon = - \frac{P_{m}a_{2}}{\alpha}$. The
expression for $P$, thus, becomes

$$
  P = P_{m} \left[ \frac{e^{\alpha I(1+\epsilon)} - 1}{e^{\alpha I(1+\epsilon)} - \epsilon} \right].
$$

From _Conditions 1_ and _Conditions 2_ we get that the initial slope is $\alpha
P_{m}$, and that this value decreases as $P$ increases. As the slope can only
exceed this for negative values of $P$ and $I$, which have no biological
meaning, it must be that the maximum possible slope is $\alpha P_{m}$. We can
see from the expression for maximum slope that it will exceed $\alpha P_{m}$,
except for when $a_{1} = 0$. When this is the case, $a_{2} = -
\frac{\alpha}{P_{m}}$ and $\epsilon = 1$. We can, therefore, write the equation
for $\frac{\dd P}{\dd I}$ we defined above as

$$
  \frac{\dd P}{\dd I} = \alpha(P_{m} - P)\left( 1 + \frac{P}{P_{m}} \right).
$$

And so, integrating and rearranging for $P$ gives the hyperbolic tangent relation:

$$
  2\alpha I = \ln \left( \frac{P_{m} + P}{P_{m} - P} \right),
$$

$$
  P = P_{m}\left( \frac{e^{2\alpha I} - 1}{e^{2\alpha I} + 1} \right) ,
$$

$$
  P = P_{m} \tanh (\alpha I).
$$

Looking at an arbitrary plot of $P = \tanh I$ (taking $P_{m} = \alpha = 1$, just to look
at the shape):

we see that it follows the first two regimes that we expect (models for
photosynthetic rate against light intensity are only really concerned with the
light-limited and light-saturated sections).

While this model was suggested during the 70's and 80's, it has not been
implemented much in recent times in favour of models derived from expressions
similar in form to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Though it is a relatively simple
expression to model and has been found to fit experimental data reasonably well
in some studies, it has also been found to inaccurately model the light-limiting
region, particularly when modelled with other key parameters, such as specific
growth rate. However, the reason I wanted to write about this derivation didn't
really have much to do with the expression itself, but because of how we went
from something quite ugly looking,

$$
  P = P_{m}\left[ \frac{\exp\left[\alpha I\left(1 -
  \frac{P_{m}a_{2}}{\alpha}\right)\right] - 1}{\exp\left[\alpha I \left( 1 -
  \frac{P_{m}a_{2}}{\alpha} \right) \right] - \left( \frac{P_{m}a_{2}}{\alpha}
  \right) } \right],
$$

and after applying some conditions set by restrictions based on the system we're
trying to model, it collapses into a neat, little expression. 

$$
  P = P_{m} \tanh (\alpha I).
$$

Whether or not the expression has found use in modelling microalgae growth, I
still think this is pretty cool.
